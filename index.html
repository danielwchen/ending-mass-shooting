    <p>
      The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as any incident in which 4 or more people are shot and/or killed, not including the shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By their definition, <a href='http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/'>the Gun Violence Archive</a> has recorded 319 mass shootings in 2017 as of November 17. In the 12 days since the Texas church shooting on November 5, when 27 people lost their lives, 13 more people have died and 56 have been injured in mass shooting incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past year, mass shootings in America have become so common that the president seems to be copy and pasting his statements between incidents, changing (or failing to this case) only the location.

      The post-mass-shooting-cycle has become repetitive. Politicians offer <a href='http://time.com/5011550/texas-church-shooting-thoughts-prayers-gun-control/'>"thoughts and prayers"</a> on social media. Democrats rush to propose gun control legislation while Republicans accuse their counterparts of politicizing a tragedy. The Onion article, "<a href='https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527'>‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens"</a>, goes viral once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one particularly insidious argument gets revived again and again: the Good Guy with a Gun.
    </p>

    <h2>Good Guy with a Gun</h2>
    <p>
      In 2012, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said, "The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this argument, to reduce mass shootings, Americans need <i>more</i> guns. In fact, regulations on guns only prevent innocent bystanders from carrying enough firearms to end mass shootings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, similar arguments have been made by <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/07/politics/trump-extreme-vetting-guns-korea/index.html'>President Trump after the Texas Church shooting</a>, <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/12/good-guys-with-guns-saving-lives.html'>columnists at Fox News</a>, and <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/gop-congressman-wants-members-of-congress-to-be-able-to-carry-guns-everywhere-including-dc/2017/06/19/881d3dfc-5523-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.08a12e083005'>other lawmakers</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      This argument has been used to push legislation increasing the presence of guns in previously barred locations. Missouri, for example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/missouri-guns-schools-law-concealed-open-governor">passed a law in 2014</a> which allows trained employees to bring firearms to schools.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      There are certainly several instances of people with firearms stopping shooters. Eugene Volokh, an opinion writer at the Washington Post, published <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/03/do-civilians-with-guns-ever-stop-mass-shootings/'>a list in 2015</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These examples describe commendable actions by brave individuals. However, their actions don't represent what happens on a larger scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several analyses have shown that states with more increased legal gunownership do not see decreases in gun-related crimes. Research conducted at the <a href='Harvard Injury Control Research Center'>Harvard Injury Control Research Center</a> found that increased gun availability is linked with increases in gun homicides, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the US, states with more guns generally see more deaths due to firearms. The first map below illustrates the rate of registered gun ownership in each state using data from 2013 and 2014, as compiled by <a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/most-heavily-armed-states-in-america/?ftag=ACQ449302a&vndid=1845235018&ttag=cbsn-fb-1038&nan_pid=1845235018'>CBS News</a>. The second map displays the rate of gun deaths in each state in 2015, as compiled by <a href='https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D'>the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.
    </p>
    <div id="map-container">
      <div class='vis' id="vis1"></div>
      <div class='vis' id="vis2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Good Guy with a Gun" proponents insist that the benefits of increasing gun ownership for good guys should outweigh the negative consequences, so we would expect that states with more gun ownership would have lower rates of homicide. Instead, the maps show several similarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the rate of gun ownership in a state correlates with its rate of gun deaths.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id="vis3"></div>
    <p>
      Though this alone is not enough to suggest that increased gun availability <i>causes</i> increased gun deaths, it shows that increasing gun availability is not a reasonable solution.
    </p>
    <h2>How many Good Guys are there?</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- A more specific study of shootings also casts doubt on the "Good Guy with a Gun" story.  -->In 2013, the <a href='https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-study-2000-2013-1.pdf/view'>FBI released a report</a> analyzing the 160 events between 2000 and 2013 that were catagorized as "active shooter incidents," defined in the study as “an individual [or individuals] actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of the report focused on how active shooter incidents are resolved, where a "Good Guy with a Gun" may have intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of incidents end after police intervention. Only 40% of incidents end before police arrival.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-pie'></div>
    <p>
      Out of the fraction of shootings that end before police arrival, most end because of suicide, <b>not</b> civilian interference. In the 26 incidents stopped by civilians, civilians were only armed in 5.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-bar'></div>
    <p>
      The majority of the 160 shootings analyzed by the FBI ended on the shooter's initiative. In most cases, it isn't the police, heroic bystanders, or a "good guy with a gun" who end a mass shooter's spree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is a "Good Guy with a Gun" far from typical, in most cases a shooting doesn't stop until the shooter makes the decision to end their spree.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-pie2'></div>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, over half of shootings don't end until the shooter decides to commit suicide, give up, or flee that ends killings.
    </p>
    <p>
      These results show that shooting events ended by armed civilians are very rare. They are outnumbered by incidents ended by law enforcement, suicide, and even unarmed civilians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good guys with a gun do exist, but they are ineffective as a policy for ending mass shootings.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Finding an end to mass shootings is a complicated task. However, it is too important to give up on. The "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative has been used to present ineffective legislation and drown out legitimate attempts to curb gun violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counterargument to the "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative is not that it is impossible. There are armed civilians, such as Stephen Willeford at Sutherland Springs, who have stood up to help stop mass shootings. However, the story is misleading and is used to shut down alternative proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer very well could include increasing the presence of <i>well-trained</i> armed security personnel in public areas, but it will also require changes in mental health policies, background check laws, and perhaps even gun ownership laws. Most importantly, the search for the answer won't even be possible until we can approach the problem with open minds and a willingness to discard faulty, misleading narratives.
