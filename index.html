  <div class='container'>
    <p>
      The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as any incident in which 4 or more people are shot and/or killed, not including the shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By their definition, <a href='http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/'>the Gun Violence Archive</a> has recorded 319 mass shootings in 2017 as of November 17. In the 12 days since the Texas church shooting on November 5, when 27 people lost their lives, 13 more people have died and 56 have been injured in mass shooting incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past year, mass shootings in America have become so common that the president seems to be copy and pasting his statements between incidents, changing (or failing to this case) only the location.

      And after each mass shooting, the

    <p>
      Politicians become increasingly predictable with each event as well. Republicans offer "thoughts and prayers" on social media while Democrats fume at their inactions. Democrats rush to point at proposed gun control legislation while Republicans accuse their counterparts of politicizing a tragedy. Eventually, everyone slowly forgets about 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is one particularly insidious narrative that arises after each mass shooting: the "Good Guy with a Gun" story. 
    </p>

    <h3>Good Guy with a Gun</h3>
    <p>
      In 2012, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said, "The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, similar arguments have been made by <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/07/politics/trump-extreme-vetting-guns-korea/index.html'>President Trump after the Texas Church shooting</a>, <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/12/good-guys-with-guns-saving-lives.html'>columnists at Fox News</a>, and <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/gop-congressman-wants-members-of-congress-to-be-able-to-carry-guns-everywhere-including-dc/2017/06/19/881d3dfc-5523-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.08a12e083005'>other lawmakers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This argument has been used to push legislation increasing the presence of guns in previously barred locations. Missouri, for example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/missouri-guns-schools-law-concealed-open-governor">passed a law in 2014</a> which allows trained school employees to carry concealed guns on campus and drops the age requirement for a concealed weapons permit from 21 to 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good guy with a gun" proponents point to several 
    </p>
    <p>
      Several analyses have shown that states with more increased legal gunownership do not see decreases in gun-related crimes. The first map below illustrates the rate of registered gun ownership in each state using data from 2013 and 2014. The second map displays the rate of gun deaths in each state in 2015.
    </p>
    <div id="map-container">
      <div class='vis' id="vis1"></div>
      <div class='vis' id="vis2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
      If the "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative were true, then the benefits of increased gun ownership should outweight its negative impacts. Instead, the maps show more similarities than differences. In fact, the number of deaths caused by guns correlates with the number of firearms per person.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id="vis3"></div>
    <p>
      Though this alone is not enough to suggest that more guns <i>cause</i> more gun deaths, it shows that increasing gun availability is not the solution that the "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative suggests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013, the <a href='https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-study-2000-2013-1.pdf/view'>FBI released a report</a> in which they analyzed the 160 events between 2000 and 2013 that were catagorized as "active shooter incidents," defined in the study as “an individual [or individuals] actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A scenario where it is necessary for an armed civilian to stop an active shooter would probably happen before police intervention. However, only 40% of incidents end before police arrival.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-pie'></div>
    <p>
      Out of the fraction of shootings that end before police arrival, the majority end because of suicide, <b>not</b> civilian interference. In the 26 incidents stopped by civilians, civilians were only armed in 5.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-bar'></div>
    <p>
      In 160 shootings analyzed between 2000 and 2013, only 5 were stopped by 
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the 160 shootings analyzed by the FBI ended on the shooter's initiative. In most cases, it isn't the police, heroic bystanders, or a "good guy with a gun" who end a mass shooter's spree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is a "Good Guy with a Gun" far from typical, in most cases a shooting doesn't stop until the shooter makes the decision to end their spree.
    </p>
    <div class='vis' id='vis-pie2'></div>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, over half of shootings don't end until the shooter's decision to commit suicide, give up, or flee that ends killings.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Finding an end to mass shootings is a complicated task. However, it is too important to give up on. The "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative has been peddled by 
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed civilians, such as Stephen Willeford at Sutherland Springs, who stand up and help stop mass shootings are heroes. However, the "Good Guy with a Gun" narrative is not only incorrect, it tries to suppress alternative proposals to try to prevent mass shootings from ever starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer very well could include increasing the presence of <i>well-trained</i> armed security personnel in public areas, but it will also require changes in mental health policies, background check laws, and perhaps even gun ownership laws. Most importantly, the search for the answer won't even be possible until we can approach the problem with open minds and a willingness to discard faulty, misleading narratives.
